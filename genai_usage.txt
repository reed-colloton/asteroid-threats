Project Overview
Your application must have a GUI, a database, API data source(optional), a middle layer connecting your UI to your data. The code
should be built within Docker containers so they are portable. Make sure to consider these core requirements when designing the
architecture of your application. You are required to use the technology stack that you have learned in this course. Refer to the
project guide for detailed expectations. If you would like clarifications, please ask your instructor/TA.

Deliverables
Before starting this discussion, assign a scribe who will start a document and take notes on the items listed below. The team will
proofread and submit this document as your deliverable for this week. Please refer to Canvas for the due date.

1. Team Number
You have been assigned a team number, on Canvas, that is represented as your recitation section number plus a one-digit identifier.
This team number MUST appear on ALL deliverables/submissions posted by your team to your git repository and to Canvas.

2. Team name
You will collectively choose a name for your team to represent a vision you have for the application you're creating. It can be used
in addition to your Team Number for all deliverables and presentations.

3. Team Members
List the First & Last name of team members, their GitHub usernames and their email addresses.

4. Application Name
Pick a befitting name to convey the purpose of your application. To be used in all presentations(weekly to your TA and the final one)

5. Application Description
A short (2-3 paragraphs) overview description of the application. Provide enough information to explain what functionality and value
your product will provide to users of your application. This should help you to define the scope of your project.

6. Audience
Define the target audience for your application by identifying the characteristics of an ideal user. Clearly articulate the specific
problem your software aims to solve for this user group. Additionally, consider the usability and accessibility of the application,
ensuring that interactions are intuitive and convenient for the intended audience.

Understanding their background helps shape features and design.

7. Vision Statement
A simple, one or two sentence statement describing the clear and inspirational desired state resulting from your team’s efforts to
create your application. Following is a template you might want to use:

For [target customer], Who [statement of the need]. The [product name] is a [product category] that [key benefit, compelling reason
to buy]. Unlike [primary competitive alternative], our product [statement of primary differentiation]

Examples
Amazon: “To be Earth’s most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online.”
Tesla: “To create the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving the world’s transition to electric vehicles.”
Facebook: “People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what’s going on in the world, and to share and
express what matters to them.”
CU Boulder: “To be a leader in addressing the humanitarian, social, and technological challenges of the twenty-first century.”
IKEA: “To create a better everyday life for many people.”
Nordstrom: “Offer the customer the best possible service, selection,quality, and value.”
Google: “To provide access to the world’s information in one click.”
8. Version Control
info
You are required to create a public GitHub repository and add all the members of the team to it. Share the link to this repository in
 this document.

This repository should have the following folders:

TeamMeetingLogs - The minutes of the meeting with your TA every week will be recorded in a file here. You will be updating the same
file every week with the latest updates. Points to include in the minutes would be:
Decisions made
Alternative actions/options discussed
Follow-up items, including agreed-on roles and responsibilities
MilestoneSubmissions - All course-related documents, including this one, will be stored in this folder.
ProjectSourceCode - The source code and all relevant project documentation for the application will be stored in this folder.
ReadMe.md - Refer to the project guide for more information on this.
For a detailed view of your repository, refer to the project guide
.gitignore - Please remember to create a .gitignore file in your "ProjectSourceCode" folder in the repository
9. Development Methodology
Since this project is scheduled for 4 weeks, we encourage you to use an Agile Methodology. You can also use a hybrid set of practices
 from different methodologies. For example, you can use Scrum meetings and Kanban boards to track the progress of your project. The
important thing is to have a plan and stick to it.

10. Communication Plan
Describe in a sentence or two how your team plans to communicate with each other during the course of the project. You must identify
a collaboration tool for team members to utilize for coordination of their work and communication among team members and with the TA.
 Some tools you could use: MS Teams, Slack, Discord, Google Groups, etc. Please refrain from using IMs for the purposes of this
project.

tip
You can track communication for project development tasks as comments on the user story issues you create on the GitHub project
board. That will help you remain organized.

11. Meeting Plan
Team Meeting: Identify the day(s) and time(s), mode, and location your team has agreed upon for regular meetings. “Modality” refers
to how you are meeting (face-to-face), group video chat (like Zoom, Google Meet), etc.
Weekly meeting with TA: You will also mention the meeting day, time and location (physical or online) for the weekly meeting with
your TA here.
Please refer to these instructions for expectations in your weekly meeting with your TAs. Do read the entire section carefully.
12. Use Case Diagram
Create a high-level Use Case Diagram for your application. Your diagram must show at least 6 key features of your application.

This activity should help you identify the end users of the application and the ways they would interact with the system. You can
reference the examples covered in class. This will also help you scope out the features of your application. You can refer to this
page for more information on how to create a Use Case Diagram.

13. Wireframes
You will create wireframes for each page of the application.

Wireframes are low-fidelity visual representations of the user interface of your application. They are used to plan the layout of the
 application and to communicate the flow of the application to the team. You can use any tool of your choice to create the
wireframes. Hand sketched wireframes are also acceptable. You can refer to this for more information on why and how to create
wireframes.

       22
       23 -  [Write 2-3 paragraphs describing your application]
       23 +  The Asteroid Threat Tracker (ATT) is a web-based application designed to monitor and display information about
          + potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids that pose threats to our planet. The application provides users with
          + comprehensive data about asteroid trajectories, impact probabilities, and threat assessments across multiple time
          + horizons. By aggregating data from space agencies and astronomical databases, ATT serves as a centralized platform for
          +  tracking celestial threats and raising public awareness about planetary defense.
       24
       25 -  **Paragraph 1:** Describe what your application does and its main purpose. What problem does it solve? What is the
          - core functionality?
       25 +  The application features an intuitive interface that allows users to filter asteroid threats by different time
          + periods (2030, 2040, 2050, 2075, 2100, 2150, and 2200), categorize asteroids by threat level ("Top Threats" vs "High
          + Chance"), and view detailed information about each near-Earth object including size, velocity, trajectory, and impact
          + probability. Users can explore the "Top 10 Earth Threat Asteroids" through an interactive display that presents
          + critical data in an accessible format. The system will pull real-time data from NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) API and
          +  other astronomical data sources, storing historical records in a database for trend analysis and comparison.
       26
       27 -  **Paragraph 2:** Explain the key features and capabilities. How will users interact with the application? What makes
          - it valuable?
       27 +  Within the 4-week development cycle, we will implement the core data retrieval and display functionality, database
          + integration for storing asteroid information, user interface with temporal filtering capabilities, and a responsive
          + design that works across devices. The application will be built using Node.js/Express for the backend API layer,
          + PostgreSQL for persistent data storage, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and will integrate with NASA's NEO API
          + as an external data source. All components will be containerized using Docker to ensure portability and consistent
          + deployment across different environments.
       28
       29 -  **Paragraph 3:** Discuss the scope of your project. What will be included in this 4-week development cycle? What
          - technologies will you leverage?
       30 -
       31 -  **Example:**
       32 -  > Our application is a comprehensive task management system designed for college students to organize their academic
          - responsibilities, track deadlines, and collaborate on group projects. The platform integrates calendar functionality,
          - project boards, and real-time notifications to help students stay on top of their coursework and commitments.
       33 -  >
       34 -  > Key features include personalized dashboards, assignment tracking with priority levels, integration with course
          - management systems, collaborative workspaces for group projects, and automated deadline reminders. Users can create
          - tasks, set due dates, assign them to categories (classes), and share project boards with classmates for seamless
          - collaboration.
       35 -  >
       36 -  > Within the 4-week development cycle, we will implement the core task management functionality, user authentication,
          -  database integration, and a responsive web interface. The application will be built using Node.js/Express for the
          - backend, PostgreSQL for data storage, and a modern frontend framework, all containerized using Docker for easy
          - deployment and portability.

          + planetary defense. The primary demographic ranges from high school students to adults of all ages who have an interest
          +  in space science but may not have advanced technical or astronomical knowledge. Secondary users include science
          + teachers looking for educational resources and amateur astronomers tracking near-Earth objects.
       34
       35 -  **Problem Being Solved:** [What specific pain point or need does your application address for this audience?]
       35 +  **Problem Being Solved:** Information about potentially hazardous asteroids is scattered across multiple technical
          + sources like NASA's JPL database, scientific papers, and specialized astronomical software. This data is often
          + presented in technical formats that are difficult for non-experts to interpret and compare. There is no centralized,
          + user-friendly platform that presents asteroid threat information in an accessible way while allowing users to explore
          + threats across different time horizons. People interested in planetary defense and space threats lack a simple tool to
          +  understand which asteroids pose the greatest risks and when.

       46 -  **Example:**
       47 -  > **Who:** College students aged 18-25 who are juggling multiple courses, assignments, and group projects
          - simultaneously. These users are tech-savvy but often overwhelmed by competing deadlines and lack effective tools to
          - manage academic workload.
       48 -  >
       49 -  > **Problem Being Solved:** Students struggle to keep track of assignment due dates across multiple courses, often
          - missing deadlines or experiencing last-minute stress. Group projects suffer from poor coordination and lack of
          - centralized task tracking. Existing solutions are either too complex (enterprise tools) or too simple (basic to-do
          - lists) for the specific needs of academic work.

> Vision statement: Raising awareness about dangerous asteroids in a kid-friendly manner
Team name: Woodwinds
Application Name: Asteroid Detector 3000
Target Audience: Middle school aged kids
Application Description: The main page provides a list of asteroids most likely to hit Earth in the next several thousand years, and
how much damage they could do. Other features would allow users to be given more data about a chosen asteroid, and charts that
explain details about asteroids.
Communication plan: We have a text chat, and plan to meet weekly over Zoom
5 potential risks:
1) If the website isn’t intuitive to use. This could prevent some people from using it, but this could be mitigated with icons and
putting all links in the nav bar.
2) If the external API we’re using changes or goes down. This would completely brick our website, so we’ll make a backup database
copy just in case
3) If our calculations end up being completely wrong. This wouldn’t make the application stop working, but providing misleading or
incorrect estimates about asteroid risk wouldn’t be ideal. At the very least, we’ll check a few calculations with what scientists
have made to make sure we’re in the right ballpark.
4) If we get rate-limited by the external API. This could cause our website to slow down or stop working completely, so we’d need to
figure out what that limit is, and slow down requests if we get close to it.
5) If we get caught up in scope creep. This would hurt our ability to get out a working, complete project by the deadline, so we’ll
need to make sure to have a minimum viable product with plenty of time to spare. Project Overview

       20
       21 -  The Asteroid Threat Tracker (ATT) is a web-based application designed to monitor and display information about
          - potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids that pose threats to our planet. The application provides users with
          - comprehensive data about asteroid trajectories, impact probabilities, and threat assessments across multiple time
          - horizons. By aggregating data from space agencies and astronomical databases, ATT serves as a centralized platform for
          -  tracking celestial threats and raising public awareness about planetary defense.
       21 +  The main page provides a list of asteroids most likely to hit Earth in the next several thousand years, and how much
          + damage they could do. Other features would allow users to be given more data about a chosen asteroid, and charts that
          + explain details about asteroids.
       22
       23 -  The application features an intuitive interface that allows users to filter asteroid threats by different time
          - periods (2030, 2040, 2050, 2075, 2100, 2150, and 2200), categorize asteroids by threat level ("Top Threats" vs "High
          - Chance"), and view detailed information about each near-Earth object including size, velocity, trajectory, and impact
          - probability. Users can explore the "Top 10 Earth Threat Asteroids" through an interactive display that presents
          - critical data in an accessible format. The system will pull real-time data from NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) API and
          -  other astronomical data sources, storing historical records in a database for trend analysis and comparison.
       24 -
       25 -  Within the 4-week development cycle, we will implement the core data retrieval and display functionality, database
          - integration for storing asteroid information, user interface with temporal filtering capabilities, and a responsive
          - design that works across devices. The application will be built using Node.js/Express for the backend API layer,
          - PostgreSQL for persistent data storage, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and will integrate with NASA's NEO API
          - as an external data source. All components will be containerized using Docker to ensure portability and consistent
          - deployment across different environments.

       25 -  **Target User Profile:**
       25 +  **Target Audience:** Middle school aged kids
       26
       27 -  **Who:** Space enthusiasts, educators, students, science journalists, and general public interested in astronomy and
          - planetary defense. The primary demographic ranges from high school students to adults of all ages who have an interest
          -  in space science but may not have advanced technical or astronomical knowledge. Secondary users include science
          - teachers looking for educational resources and amateur astronomers tracking near-Earth objects.
       28 -
       29 -  **Problem Being Solved:** Information about potentially hazardous asteroids is scattered across multiple technical
          - sources like NASA's JPL database, scientific papers, and specialized astronomical software. This data is often
          - presented in technical formats that are difficult for non-experts to interpret and compare. There is no centralized,
          - user-friendly platform that presents asteroid threat information in an accessible way while allowing users to explore
          - threats across different time horizons. People interested in planetary defense and space threats lack a simple tool to
          -  understand which asteroids pose the greatest risks and when.
       30 -
       31 -  **Usability & Accessibility Considerations:**
       32 -  - Clean, intuitive interface that doesn't require astronomical expertise to navigate
       33 -  - Clear visual indicators for threat levels using color coding and icons
       34 -  - Mobile-responsive design for users to check asteroid information on any device
       35 -  - Simple temporal navigation allowing quick switching between time periods
       36 -  - Accessible data presentation with both visual and textual information
       37 -  - Fast loading times and efficient data presentation to maintain user engagement
       38 -  - "Pull to refresh" functionality for mobile users to get latest data updates

       15    ## Project Description
       16
       17 -  The Asteroid Threat Tracker (ATT) is a web-based application designed to monitor and display information about
          - potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids that pose threats to our planet. By aggregating data from NASA's Near-Earth
          -  Object (NEO) API and other astronomical databases, ATT serves as a centralized platform for tracking celestial
          - threats and raising public awareness about planetary defense.
       17 +  The main page provides a list of asteroids most likely to hit Earth in the next several thousand years, and how much
          + damage they could do. Other features would allow users to be given more data about a chosen asteroid, and charts that
          + explain details about asteroids.
       18
       19 -  The application features an intuitive interface that allows users to filter asteroid threats by different time
          - periods (2030-2200), categorize asteroids by threat level, and view detailed information about each near-Earth object
          - including size, velocity, trajectory, and impact probability. Users can explore comprehensive threat data in an
          - accessible format designed for space enthusiasts, educators, students, and the general public.
       20 -
       19    ## Vision Statement
       20
       21    For space enthusiasts and the general public, who want to stay informed about potentially hazardous near-Earth
            asteroids but find existing data sources too technical and fragmented, Asteroid Threat Tracker is a web-based
            monitoring platform that provides accessible, consolidated information about Earth-threatening asteroids across
            multiple time horizons. Unlike NASA's technical JPL databases or complex astronomical software, our product presents
            threat data in an intuitive, visually engaging format that anyone can understand, with the ability to explore asteroid
             risks from the present day through the year 2200.
